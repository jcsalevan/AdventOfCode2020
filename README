Advent of Code 2020
JC Salevan, December 2020

This is a pile of hastily-written little code snippets. Lots of them are UGLY, 
or slow, or brute-forced, or just gross. That's ok! The point, for me, is just 
solving the puzzle and enjoying myself.

Each day, there's a new puzzle, with input (a .txt file) and its associated code 
(a .R script). Day 1 is AoC1, Day 2 is AoC2, etc.

For more info about this whole endeavor, see:
